// A tree is an intrusive N-ary tree using the left-child / right-sibling representation.
// Nodes must embed five pointers of the same node type:
//   parent, first_child, last_child, next_sibling, prev_sibling.
// All structural operations are O(1).
// Depth-first preorder traversal is fully iterative via parent backtracking — no stack required.

// TREE_IS_ROOT checks if a node has no parent (i.e. it is a root node).
