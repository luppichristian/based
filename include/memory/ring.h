// Ring Buffer
// =========================================================================

// A byte-oriented circular (ring) buffer backed by a contiguous memory region.
// Writes advance a write cursor; reads advance a read cursor. Both wrap around
// at capacity, so the buffer can be used continuously without compaction.
//
// The ring is not typed: it stores raw bytes. Callers are responsible for
// framing (e.g. fixed-size records, length-prefixed messages).
//
// Thread safety is optional: supply a valid mutex in opt_mutex to enable it,
// or pass NULL to treat the ring as single-threaded.
typedef struct ring {
  u8* ptr;          // Base pointer to the backing buffer.
  sz capacity;      // Total byte capacity of the backing buffer.
  sz read_pos;      // Read cursor (byte offset within [0, capacity)).
  sz write_pos;     // Write cursor (byte offset within [0, capacity)).
  sz count;         // Number of bytes currently stored.
  allocator parent; // Used when the backing buffer was auto-allocated.
  mutex opt_mutex;  // Thread-safety guard; NULL means no locking.
  b8 buf_owned;     // True when ptr was allocated through parent.
  b8 mutex_owned;   // True when opt_mutex was created by ring_create_mutexed.
} ring;

// Creates a ring backed by an existing caller-owned buffer.
// ptr      — base of the backing buffer; must remain valid for the lifetime of the ring.
// capacity — byte size of the buffer; must be > 0.
// opt_mutex — mutex that guards every operation; pass NULL to disable locking.

// Returns the number of bytes actually read (may be less than size if the
// ring holds fewer bytes than requested).

// Copies up to size bytes from the ring into out without advancing the read
// cursor. Repeated calls to ring_peek return the same bytes.
// Returns the number of bytes peeked.

// Advances the read cursor by up to size bytes without copying any data.
// Returns the number of bytes actually skipped.
